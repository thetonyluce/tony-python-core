1 - What is a string?

A python string is a sequence of character (aka text).

2 - What is an index?

The number of characters in a string, with each value corresponding to a specific character in the string.

3 - What letter will the following code print? Why?

    word = 'hello'
    index_two = word[2]
    print index_two

    l - because indexes begin with 0

4 - What is the len() functions used for?

Determining the length of a string.

5 - How can you get the last character of a word using the len() function?

user_input = input ("Write something: ")
word_length = len(user_input)
print (user_input[word_length-1])

6 - What is string slicing and how does it work?

It allows you to create segments from strings. Works like index but with start/end values.

string[start:end]

7 - How to do slice the string "python" to produce the string "thon"?

python[2:6]

8 - How can you use slicing to store the first and last character of a word in separate variables?

word = 'banana hammock'
x = word[0]
y = word[-1]

9 - What are the answers to Exercise 8.4 (p.96) from the textbook?

See exercise.

10 - Can you change one or more character of a string? Why or why not?

No - strings are immutable.

11 - What is invocation?

A call to a method or a function is called an invocation.

12 - How do you invoke the find() method on the string word with the value 'hello' to find the index of the letter e?

word = "hello"
index = word.find(e)

hello.find(e)

13 - Complete Exercise 8.5 (p.96) (Caesar cypher) from the textbook.

ecret = "I hear the gooseberries are doing well this year, and so are the mangoes."
cipher = 7

abc = list('abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz')
encrypted = ""

for char in secret: # for every charater in secret message
    if char.lower(secret) in abc:  # if it's a lowercase letter from the abc list
        for i, j in enumerate(abc):  # enumerate characters in abs - e.g. 1 a, 2 b, etc
            if j == char.lower():  # if there's a lower case letter
                new_char = abc[(i + cipher) % len(abc)]  # create a new_char from abc list that has a value of 7 positions different than the original character.
    else:
        encrypted += char


14 - Follow the directions for Exercise 8.1 (p.79) until you feel comfortable with the string methods and what methods are available.



15 - How is the in operator used?

      Will return a True or False
