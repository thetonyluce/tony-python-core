1 - What is the difference between a list and a dictionary?

A dictionary is like a list, but more general. In a list, the indices have to be integers; in a dictionary they can be (almost) any type.

A dictionary contains a collection of indices, which are called keys, and a collection of values. Each key is associated with a single value. The association of a key and a value is called a key-value pair or sometimes an item.

2 - What is a key-value pair?

A key can be used to look up a value in a dictionary.

3 - How do you add an item to the dictionary first_dict using square
    brackets?

first_dict[key] = value

4 - How do you add several items to the dictionary first_dict using
    curly braces?

first_dict =  = {'one': 'uno', 'two': 'dos', 'three}

5 - When you print out a dictionary, is there a order to the items?
    Why or why not?

    nope. dictionaries are unordered.

6 - How do you print out a value using a key?

print

7 - How does the in operator work with dictionaries?

8 - What is an implementation?

9 - Write an example for loop to traverse a dictionary loop_dict and
    print out the keys and values.

10 - How can you find search for a key given a value.
    What is this called?

11 - Can lists be keys of a dictionary? Why or why not?

12 - Can lists be values of a dictionary? Why or why not?

13 - What is a global variable?

14 - How do you reassign a global variable inside of a function?

15 - When do you not need to use the "global" keyword to modify the
    value of a global variable?
