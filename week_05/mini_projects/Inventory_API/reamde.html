<h1>WELCLOME TO THE INVENTORY API 9000</h1>
<p>Oh hey. Glad you decided to stop by and take a look at this here API
for really, really, really basic inventory management.<p>
<p>Using the <strong>InventoryAPI9000</strong> (that's what we'll call it from now on) you can
read an existing inventory, add new items, update values for items, and even
whack an item out of existence. Calls are simple - even Trump could read em!<p>

<h2>==== TO CHECK INVENTORY ====</h2>
<p>Send an HTTP GET request using the following syntax:<p>
<p><i>http://localhost:8000/inventory</i><p>

<h2>==== TO CHECK THE QTY OF AN ITEM ====</h2>
<p>Send an HTTP GET request using the following syntax:</p>
<p><i>http://localhost:8000/inventory/Item_Name</i></p>
<p>* Item_Name must be a name of an item in inventory and is case sensitive
  e.g. http://localhost:8080/inventory/Pants</p>

<h2>==== TO CHANGE THE QTY OF AN ITEM ====</h2>
<p>Send an HTTP PATCH request using the following syntax:</p>
<p><i>http://localhost:8000/inventory/Item_Name?delta=qty</p></i>
<p>* where qty is a positive or negative integer
  e.g. http://localhost:8000/inventory/Pants?delta=5 to add qty 5 for item Pants<p>

<h2>==== TO ADD AN ITEM TO INVENTORY ====</h2>
<p>Send an HTTP POST request using the following syntax:</p>
<p><i>http://localhost:8000/inventory/Item_Name?CREATE_ME_PLEASE</i></p>
<p>* where the item really wants to be created<p>
<p>e.g.<i>http://localhost:8000/inventory/Banana_Split?CREATE_ME_PLEASE</i> to create a Banana Split</p>
<p>* If only it was that easy, right? *</p>

<h2>==== TO ADD AN ITEM COMPLETELY FROM INVENTORY ====</h2>
<p>Send an HTTP DELETE request using the following syntax:<p>
<p><i>http://localhost:8000/inventory/Item_Name?DELETE_ME_PLEASE</i></p>
<p>* where the item really doesn't want to be deleted but is polite about it</p>
<p>e.g. <i>http://localhost:8000/inventory/Banana_Split?DELETE_ME_PLEASE</i> to delete a Banana Split<p>
<p>* DELETE a Banana Split, kill an Angel. Just sayin.*<p>
