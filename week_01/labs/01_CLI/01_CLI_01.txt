# Fundamentals Exercise 1: CLI

Perform the following tasks using the CLI and copy and paste the commands and results below.

- Navigate to your home directory

cd Users/anthonyluce

- Create a new directory called CodingNomads. We will use this folder to house materials for the course.

mkdir CodingNomads

- Move into the CodingNomads folder

cd CodingNomads

- Create new folder cli_testing

mkdir cli_testing

- Inside of folder cli_testing,
    a. print the directory path

        ➜  CodingNomads pwd
        /Users/anthonyluce/CodingNomads/cli_testing

    b. create 3 new .txt files all with different names (file1.txt, file2.txt, file3.txt)

        touch file1.txt
        touch file2.txt
        touch file3.txt

    c. list the contents of the folder

     ➜  CodingNomads ls
     cli_testing file1.txt   file2.txt   file3.txt

    d. rename one of the files

    mv <file1.txt> <file4.txt>

- Inside of folder cli_testing, create a new folder

    mkdir new_folder

- Copy a file from cli_testing to the new folder

    cp file1.txt new_folder

- Move a different file from cli_testing to the new folder

    mv file2.txt new_folder

- Demonstrate removing:
    a. A file

    rm file2.txt

    b. A folder

    rm -r new_folder

## vim
    a. Use $ vim to write some text inside a file

        vim
        i
        This is a text file!
        :wq text.txt

    b. Use $ cat print contents of file

        ➜  cli_testing cat text.txt
        This is a text file!

    c. Use $ grep to search for a word inside file

        ➜  cli_testing grep This text.txt
        This is a text file!

## explore advanced CLI
- What is the difference between the two commands > and >>?

> will create or overwrite a file
>> will append it

- Append the text "how?!" of hello.txt to my_file.txt

  cat hello.txt >> my_file.txt

- Overwrite the content of my_file.txt with "tell me"

  echo "tell me" > my_file.txt
  cat myfile.txt
